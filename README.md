# EVPython

All who enter the realm of software engineering are, at some point in time, faced with data structures in one way or another.
The ease of understanding these new and intimidating concepts can vary and is often made difficult due to the apparent abstraction it presents.
A way to facilitate this is with simulated visuals, which is what this new programming language proposes;
to create a beginner friendly language to provide its user with a better understanding of the data structures they use and their manipulation.
By facilitating the visualization of data structures during the learning process.

It is worth pointing out that many visualizers for data structures already exist but not as many that can provide a clear comparison of the users'
code along with their ongoing changes. This in turn, can supply a more customized understanding of the structures versus the already
preexisting methods (e.g. sorting algorithms). By giving the user a chance to write their code and see it visually executed,
we can ease and facilitate their learning process for themselves at their own pace.  


Language Features: 

- Creates visuals that demonstrate change in modifications to common data types (list, queue, stacks, LinkedList)  

- Clean easy to use code that does not require many lines of code to produce an output 

- Declarative Object-Oriented language.
